If the GraphQL [publisher] web service goes down or becomes unavailable,
   the GraphQL [subscriber] client simply stops receiving events.

Interestingly, an active subscription by an external client is necessary to see the tap effects.
What happens to the "lost" events that were successfully published during a time without a subscribed client?
